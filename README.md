# 🧩 Bundle Builder – L2 Coding Round Submission

This is my submission for the **Level 2 Coding Assessment Round**. The project is a **Bundle Builder** application that allows users to select products and add them to a bundle. Once a minimum of 3 products is selected, a call-to-action (CTA) button is enabled to simulate adding the bundle to the cart.
